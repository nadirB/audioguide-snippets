# audioguide-snippets package

AudioGuide Command Snippets.

This is an Atom Editor Package for Dr Ben Hackbarth's [AudioGuide]([url](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/audioguide/))

Snippets allow you to enter a simple prefix in the editor and hit "Tab" to expand the prefix into a larger code block with templated values. We can continue pressing Tab and the cursor will move to the next value of the body tag or "Shift+Tab" to go backwards.

Install :

Go to Atom's preferences then to the Install tab.
Search for the audioguide-snippets package then click install (re-launch Atom if necessary : Ctrl+Option+Cmd+L).

Usage :

To see all the available snippets for the AudioGuide filetype that you currently have open, choose "Snippets: Available" in the Command Palette "Shif+Cmd+P".

Or type keywords in an audioguide python script in order to show the snippets,
and hit tab to expand the corresponding code block with templated values.   


In order to evaluate AudioGuide scripts within Atom install the platformio-ide-terminal package.
